What is a melanoma?,"Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a severe form of skin cancer characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in the skin.Melanoma is a serious condition that requires prompt medical attention and comprehensive treatment to prevent further spread and complications.",1
What are melanocytes?,"Melanocytes naturally reside in the basal layer of the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. These cells play a crucial role in protecting the skin by producing melanin, a pigment that absorbs ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. Normally, the growth of melanocytes leads to the formation of benign skin features such as moles (benign melanocytic naevi) and freckles (ephelides and lentigines). However, when melanocytes undergo cancerous transformation, melanoma develops.",1

"What is meant by de novo melanomas in the context of skin cancer?","De novo melanomas refer to melanomas that develop spontaneously without being associated with pre-existing moles. While the presence of many moles (melanocytic naevi) is a risk factor for some types of melanomas, the majority of melanomas arise independently. This emphasizes the importance of regular skin examinations and vigilance in detecting melanomas, as they may not always be preceded by noticeable moles.",1
What role does UV radiation play in melanoma development?,"UV radiation, from sunlight or tanning beds, is a significant risk factor for melanoma. It damages skin cell DNA, increasing the likelihood of cancerous cell formation.",1
How does a family history of melanoma influence an individual's risk?,"Having a family history of melanoma increases an individual's risk of developing the disease, suggesting a genetic predisposition to the condition.",1
