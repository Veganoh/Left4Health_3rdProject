    "prediction": "Urticaria vasculitis is a rare form of urticaria (hives) that affects the blood vessels in the skin. It is characterized by red, raised patches or wheals on the skin that are often painful or itchy. These patches may last for longer periods of time compared to typical hives.\n\nSymptoms of urticaria vasculitis may include:\n\n1. Red or purple patches on the skin\n2. Pain or tenderness in the affected areas\n3. Itching or burning sensation\n4. Swelling of the skin\n5. Fever or fatigue in severe cases\n\nTreatment for urticaria vasculitis typically involves a combination of medications and lifestyle changes. Some common treatment options include:\n\n1. Antihistamines: These medications can help reduce itching and inflammation associated with urticaria vasculitis.\n2. Corticosteroids: In severe cases, corticosteroids may be prescribed to reduce inflammation and suppress the immune response.\n3. Immunosuppressants: These medications may be used to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation in cases where other treatments have been ineffective.\n4. Avoiding triggers: Identifying and avoiding triggers that may exacerbate symptoms, such as certain foods, medications, or environmental factors, can help manage the condition.\n\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan for urticaria vasculitis."
