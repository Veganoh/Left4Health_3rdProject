    "prediction": "Cold urticaria is a type of physical urticaria, which means it is triggered by physical stimuli such as cold temperatures. Symptoms of cold urticaria include the development of hives or welts on the skin after exposure to cold temperatures. These hives are typically red, itchy, and raised, and can vary in size and shape.\n\nIn severe cases, cold urticaria can lead to a systemic reaction known as anaphylaxis, which can cause symptoms such as difficulty breathing, swelling of the throat, and a drop in blood pressure. It is important to seek medical attention immediately if you experience these symptoms.\n\nTreatment for cold urticaria typically involves avoiding exposure to cold temperatures as much as possible. This may include wearing warm clothing, avoiding cold water or environments, and using antihistamines to help control symptoms. In some cases, a doctor may prescribe medications such as corticosteroids or leukotriene receptor antagonists to help manage symptoms.\n\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare provider if you suspect you have cold urticaria, as they can provide a proper diagnosis and recommend an appropriate treatment plan."
