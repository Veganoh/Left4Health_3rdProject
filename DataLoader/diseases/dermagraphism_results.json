This condition is also known as \"skin writing\" because the welts can be easily triggered by scratching or rubbing the skin.\n\nSymptoms of dermatographism may include:\n\n1. Raised, red welts or hives on the skin that appear shortly after pressure or friction is applied\n2. Itching or burning sensation in the affected area\n3. Swelling or inflammation of the skin\n4. The welts may come and go quickly, usually within 30 minutes to an hour\n\nTreatment for dermatographism typically involves managing the symptoms and avoiding triggers that can exacerbate the condition. Some common treatment options may include:\n\n1. Antihistamines: Over-the-counter or prescription antihistamines can help reduce itching and inflammation associated with dermatographism.\n2. Topical corticosteroids: These medications can help reduce inflammation and itching in the affected area.\n3. Avoiding triggers: Identifying and avoiding triggers that can worsen dermatographism, such as tight clothing, scratching, or rubbing the skin.\n4. Cool compresses: Applying cool compresses to the affected area can help reduce itching and inflammation.\n5. Stress management: Stress can exacerbate dermatographism, so practicing stress-reducing techniques such as meditation or yoga may help manage symptoms.\n\nIt is important to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan for dermatographism."
