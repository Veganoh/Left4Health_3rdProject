It is a skin condition that typically occurs in pregnant women, usually during the third trimester. \n\nSymptoms of PUPPP include:\n\n1. Itchy red bumps or hives that usually start on the abdomen and may spread to other parts of the body such as the thighs, buttocks, and arms.\n2. The bumps may merge together to form larger patches of raised, red, and inflamed skin.\n3. The itching can be intense and may worsen at night.\n\nTreatment for PUPPP typically involves managing the symptoms to provide relief from itching and discomfort. Some common treatment options include:\n\n1. Topical corticosteroid creams or ointments to reduce inflammation and itching.\n2. Oral antihistamines to help relieve itching and discomfort.\n3. Cool compresses or oatmeal baths to soothe the skin.\n4. Avoiding hot showers or baths, as hot water can worsen itching.\n5. Wearing loose-fitting clothing made of breathable fabrics to prevent irritation.\n\nIt is important for pregnant women experiencing symptoms of PUPPP to consult with their healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment recommendations. In some cases, more severe or persistent cases of PUPPP may require prescription medications or other interventions."
